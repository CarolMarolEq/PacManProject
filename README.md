This project served to showcase the creation and manipulation of objects. Pacman is a great visual for a fairly simple object that can be moved across the page back and forth as well as "moving" through a series of different images to create an animation.

I found this project to be particularly fun. Id love to make PacMan change color as he bounces off each wall or go through the rainbow during his travels from side to side. it would also be entertaining to have him change direction in all four directions upon click (similiar to the game)
